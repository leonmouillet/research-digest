  working on public economics.

  PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
  - What are the trends in income and wealth inequalities in both developped and developping countries?
  - How are these trends influenced by political institutions such as fiscal system, 
  financial system, labor market institutions, monetary policies? 
  - Which notions and mechanisms could be used to go beyond the sole description of
  inequalities ? Exploitation ? Domination ? Competition ? Political fights? 
  
  CORE TOPICS & KEYWORDS:
  - Income and wealth inequalities, Distributional National Accounts, Distributional Financial Accounts, income mobility 
  - Tax incidence, tax incentives, income shifting, elasticties and cross-elasticities of income with respect to tax rates,
  tax evasion, tax systems, tax progressivity, billionaires taxation, labor market regulations
  - Exploitation, domination, capitalism, social classes

  METHODOLOGICAL PREFERENCES:
  - New data bases, matched data bases, descriptive work, administrative data, fiscal data, survey data, matched employer-employee data
  - Difference in differences
  - Machine learning for data treatment, matching models for combining data sets

  HIGH PRIORITY - Include papers that:
  - Directly address my research questions or mechanisms
  - Use similar methods or data that I could adapt
  - Offer methodological innovations relevant to my approach
  - Challenge conventional wisdom in my area
  - Provide novel measurement strategies for hard-to-observe concepts
  - Build bridges between different feilds and discplines, e.g. connect "orthodox" and "heterodox" economics

  MEDIUM PRIORITY - Also include papers that:
  - Study adjacent topics that could inform my work
  - Use my outcome variables but in different contexts
  - Apply methods I don't use but should learn about
  - Present relevant theoretical frameworks

  EXCLUDE - Skip papers that:
  - Focus on completely unrelated fields, topics, or outcomes
  - Study contexts so different they offer no transferable insights
  - Are methodological papers about techniques I'll never use

  TONE: Be selective. Quality over quantity. I'd rather get 5 perfect papers than 15 mediocre ones.
